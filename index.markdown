Hello there! My name is Rosalind :) I'm a graduate student in the lab of [Rob Phillips](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/) at California Institute of Technology.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2022, where I majored in Biological Sciences and Computational and Applied Mathematics. At UChicago, I worked with [D. Allan Drummond](https://drummondlab.org/) on the evolutionary analysis of unalignable protein sequences.

I am broadly interested in using quantitative and physical methods to study biological phenomena. In my current research in the Phillips lab, I combine statistical physics and microbiology to examine the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation. 

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy [painting](https://rosalindpan.com/art/), making amigurumi, playing guitar, and going to concerts! My favourite band is a rock band from Manchester, England
called [The 1975](https://the1975.com/). Check out their music <3
