Hello there! My name is Rosalind :)

I'm a graduate student in the lab of Rob
Phillips at California Institute of Technology. I graduated from the University
 of Chicago in 2022, where I majored in Biological Sciences and Computational
 and Applied Mathematics.

I am broadly interested in using quantitative methods in the field of
mathematics and physics to study biological phenomena. In my current research in the Phillips lab,
I combine statistical physics and microbiology to examine the mechanisms underlying
transcriptional regulation. 

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy painting, making amigurumi, playing guitar,
and going to concerts! My favourite band is a rock band from Manchester, England
called [The 1975](https://the1975.com/). Check out their music!
